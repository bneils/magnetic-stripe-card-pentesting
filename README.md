# Magnetic stripe card pentesting research
This was a fun hacking process I thought of on a whim. Its motivation was my annoyance of being locked out of my college's gaming lounge - a place with large televisions that were barely in order. Also, I wanted to know what technology my college used on-campus, and what kind of information was stored on the cards. Furthermore, my biggest annoyance is that the campus' card office charges $13-$25 for a replacement. Honestly, that is ridiculous given that the cards themselves are incredibly cheap to produce and buy.

## My findings
Only two tracks, out of three, are actually in-use on our cards. I've seen the first track being read in library workshops where an attendant asks you to swipe your card and your ID (not PAN) is entered into a spreadsheet. The first track contains the PAN, last name, ID, as well as a LRC to verify the data's integrity. However, only the second track is actually used by card readers - to open doors and to process transactions on campus. The only (dynamic) information the second track contains, however, is the PAN and the LRC. About half of the PAN, according to ISO 7811, is for institutions and leased by ISO. Additionally, the last digit is used in Luhn's algorithm for a correctness check, which leaves about 5-7 digits for personnel and students.

The data being operated on is represented by the pipe-separated ISO 7811 format. I read it with the MSRX python library and a MSR605.

This contains everything you need to know (if you can find it), but I have provided in-code explanations.
