# Magnetic stripe card pentesting research
This was a fun hacking process I thought of on a whim. Its motivation was my annoyance in being locked out of my college's gaming lounge - a place with large televisions that were barely in order. Also, I wanted to know how my college handled security on-campus, and what kind of technology was stored. That aside, my biggest annoyance is that the campus' card office charges $13-$25 for a replacement. Honestly, that is ridiculous given that the cards themselves are incredibly cheap to produce and buy.

# My findings
Only two tracks, out of three, are actually in-use on our cards. The first I have seen in library workshops where an attendant asks you to swipe your card and your ID (not PAN) is printed into a spreadsheet. The first track contains the PAN, last name, ID, as well as a LRC to verify the data's integrity. However, only the second track is actually used by card readers - to open doors and to process transactions on campus. The only (dynamic) information the second track contains, however, is the PAN. About half of the PAN, according to ISO 7811, is for institutions and leased by ISO. Additionally, the last digit is used in Luhn's algorithm for a correctness check, which leaves about 5-7 digits for personnel and students.

This contains everything you need to know (if you can find it), but I have provided in-code explanations.
